# Computer Graphics using THREE.JS
### Instructions
Develop your first scene using the template code from Chapter 1 (code-1).  Create a scene with a black background and two different objects (your choice).  Put the axis helper at the origin of your scene.  Add two objects, one to the left of the axis helper and one to the right.  Add two different textures (images) to the objects.
The last thing - animate both of your objects separately.  Make them in different directions.
